                  <p>First of all, on September 2020, I started my business journey as a dropship of planner books 2021 in which the brand of the books called as Syabab Malaysia. There are 3 types of planner which is exclusive, standard and student planners. Each of it have a differences in terms of price, number of freegifts, contents, features and more. At first, I know this existence of planners brand is from my cousin, where she was an agent of Syabab planners since 2019. Thus, I decided to be one of her dropships which the name of her online shop is known as Lubuk Planner. After that, I started to create my second Twitter account for business purposes and from this platform is where I gained a lot of other sellers friends. Thus, we decided to help each other by liking, retweet their business's tweet. Fortunately, although this is my first trying in businesss but I managed to achieved my business goals so I am proud of myself. Table below shows what I have been achieved for only 4 months as a dropship from September 2020 until January 2021. </p>

                    <p>Next, I started to challenge myself in experiencing business journey by holding the planner stocks. Thus, I decided to challenge myself to invest money as a partnership agent with my cousins,so she will manage the rest of process such as packing and post out the planner and I will selling the planner through online and frequently come to her house to help her in packing the planners's order when I got a free time. Fortunately, she accepted my offer and half of the capital are made by me to buy the stocks of planners in a cheaper prices. The total of books planner that we decided to buy is 350 pieces which consists of 150 pieces of Premium planner, 100 pieces of Standard planner, 100 pieces of Student planner and 50 pieces of calendar. Thus, my commission is increase from 20% (last year) to 35% (this year). In addition to this, on this year also, I started to open dropship intake under my own shop known as <b>wnyshop</b> and promote it through social media and I am satisfied with the number of peoples that are interested to be my dropships which I do not expected that there will be many people that want to be dropships under me. Moreover, fortunately, all the stocks have almost sold out. Table below shows what I have been achieved for only 4 months as an agent from September 2021 until January 2022. </p>

The intake of the dropships is quite complicated because there are interviews conducted by the CEO. Luckily, I managed to pass the interview in November 2021 as I was confident with myself and my previous business experiences which were able to help me to answer the business related questions by the CEO of Urbancolabb planner through the Zoom Meeting platform. However, the total sales of the Urbancolabb planner that I sell is not as many as the Syabab planner, but I am still grateful of the result as it my first try to sell another brand of planner.

                  <p style="text-align: justify">Not only planners and calendars, I am also a dropship of Kakfit brand which is a personalised thermos, tumbler and bottle that allows customers to custom their name using font colours and font types that have been provided. I started to join this dropship in about February 2020 until now. Same goes to Urbancolabb dropship intake, there are also interviews conducted by the CEO through Google Meet and I managed to pass the interview. However, for this product, I am not fully focusing through virtual channels (social media), but I also sell through by mouth of mouth channels, which I am able to gain more customers through offline rather than online. Thus, from this experience, I am confident to plan to build my own physical shop as I have learned how to communicate and promote well in front of my customers. Table below shows what I have achieved for almost two year and above as a dropship from February 2020 until now.</p>
